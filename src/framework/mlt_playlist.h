/** \brief Playlist class
 *
 * A playlist is a sequential container of producers and blank spaces. The class provides all
 * sorts of playlist assembly and manipulation routines. A playlist is also a producer within
 * the framework.
 *
 * \extends mlt_producer_s
 * \properties \em autoclose Set this true if you are doing sequential processing and want to
 * automatically close producers as they are finished being used to free resources.
 * \properties \em meta.fx_cut Set true on a producer to indicate that it is a "fx_cut,"
 * which is a way to add filters as a playlist entry - useful only in a multitrack. See FxCut on the wiki.
 * \properties \em mix_in
 * \properties \em mix_out
 * \properties \em hide Set to 1 to hide the video (make it an audio-only track),
 * 2 to hide the audio (make it a video-only track), or 3 to hide audio and video (hidden track).
 * This property only applies when using a multitrack or transition.
 * \event \em playlist-next The playlist fires this when it moves to the next item in the list.
 * The listener receives one argument that is the index of the entry that just completed.
