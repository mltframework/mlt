  There are many different effects that go under the name of "diffusion",
  seemingly all of the inspired by the effect you get when you put a
  diffusion filter in front of your camera lens. The effect most people
  want is a general flattening/smoothing of the light, and reduction of
  fine detail (most notably, blemishes in people's skin), without ruining
  edges, which a regular blur would do.
  We do a relatively simple version, sometimes known as "white diffusion",
  where we first blur the picture, and then overlay it on the original
  using the original as a matte.
