description: >
  Deconvolution Sharpen is a filter that sharpens by way of deconvolution
  (i.e., trying to reverse the blur kernel, as opposed to just boosting high
  frequencies), more specifically by FIR Wiener filters. It is the same
  algorithm as used by the (now largely abandoned) Refocus plug-in for GIMP,
  and I suspect the same as in Photoshop's “Smart Sharpen” filter.
  The effect gives generally better results than unsharp masking, but can be very
  GPU intensive, and requires a fair bit of tweaking to get good results without
  ringing and/or excessive noise.
