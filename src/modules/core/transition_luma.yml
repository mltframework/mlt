  A generic dissolve and wipe transition processor.
   
  "luma" gets its name from how it uses a grayscale "map" file. As the luma
  value varies over time, a threshold filter is applied to the map to
  determine what parts of frame A vs. frame B to show. It reads PGM files up
  to 16 bits! Alternatively, it can use the first frame from any producer that
  outputs yuv, but it will be limited to the luma gamut of 220 values. This
  performs field-based rendering unless the A frame property "progressive" or
  "consumer_progressive" or the transition property "progressive" is set to 1.
bugs:
  - Assumes lower field first output.
