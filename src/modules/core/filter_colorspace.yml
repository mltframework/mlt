  Convert the image colorspace to whatever was requested by the consumer.
  This filter is designed for use as a normalizer for the loader producer.
  If the "force_trc" property is set on this filter, the filter will force
  the output trc to be "force_trc";
  Otherwise, if a property "consumer.mlt_color_trc" exists on the frame, then colorspace 
  normalizes the image to the trc requested by the consumer.
