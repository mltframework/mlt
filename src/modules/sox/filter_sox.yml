description: Process audio using a SoX effect.
bugs:
  - Some effects are stereo only, but MLT processes each channel separately.
  - Some effects have a temporal side-effect that do not work well.

      If the effect name is "analysis" then it does not run any effect.
      Instead, it analyzes the audio to determine a normalized gain level.
      The results are put into the level, peak, and gain properties as well
      as this effect property as the parameter to the vol effect.

      Use peak signal level instead of RMS (root mean square) power level to
      compute gain for normalization.

    title: Dynamic normalization
    description: >
      This computes the gain for normalization dynamically per frame, but it
      uses a sliding smoothing window to prevent the gain from fluctuating wildly.
      Currently, this must be used in combination with some SoX effect.
