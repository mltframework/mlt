parameters:
  - identifier: type
    title: Graph type
    description: The type of graph to display the spectrum.
    type: string
    default: line
    values:
      - line
      - bar
    readonly: no
    mutable: yes
    widget: combo
    
  - identifier: bgcolor
    title: Background Color
    type: color
    description: |
      The background color to be applied to the entire frame. The default color 
      is transparent.
      
      A color value is a hexadecimal representation of RGB plus alpha channel 
      as 0xrrggbbaa. Colors can also be the words: white, black, red, green,
      or blue. You can also use a HTML-style color values #rrggbb or #aarrggbb.
    readonly: no
    mutable: yes
    widget: color
    
  - identifier: color.*
    title: Foreground color
    type: color
    description: |
      The color of the waveform.
      
      Multiple colors can be specified with incrementing suffixes to cause the
      waveform to be drawn in a gradient. color.1 is the top of the waveform.
      Subsequent colors will produce a gradient toward the bottom.
      
      By default, the filter has one color defined:
      
          color.1=0xffffffff"
          
      This results in a white waveform.
      
      To create a gradient, define more colors:
      
          color.2=green color.3=0x77777777
      
      A color value is a hexadecimal representation of RGB plus alpha channel 
      as 0xrrggbbaa. Colors can also be the words: white, black, red, green,
      or blue. You can also use a HTML-style color values #rrggbb or #aarrggbb.

    description: >
      Affects the amount of curve in the line interpolating between points.
      0.0 = a straight line between points.
      1.0 = very curved lines between points.
      values < 0 and > 1 will cause loops in the lines.

  - identifier: window_size
    title: Window Size
    type: integer
    description: >
      The number of samples that the FFT will be performed on. If
      window_size is less than the number of samples in a frame, extra samples 
      will be ignored. If window_size is more than the number of samples in a 
      frame, samples will be buffered from previous frames to fill the window.
      The buffering is performed as a sliding window so that the most recent 
      samples are always transformed.
