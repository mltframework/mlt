description: >
  An audio visualization filter that colors the image proportional to the 
  magnitude of the audio spectrum.
  
parameters:
  - identifier: frequency_low
    title: Low Frequency
    type: integer
    description: >
      The low end of the frequency range to be used to influence the image 
      motion.
    mutable: yes
    readonly: no
    default: 20
    unit: Hz
    
  - identifier: frequency_high
    title: High Frequency
    type: integer
    description: >
      The high end of the frequency range to be used to influence the image 
      motion.
    mutable: yes
    readonly: no
    default: 20000
    unit: Hz
    
  - identifier: threshold
    title: Level Threshold
    type: float
    description: >
      The minimum amplitude of sound that must occur within the frequency range
      to cause the image to move.
      motion.
    mutable: yes
    readonly: no
    default: -30
    minimum: -100
    maximum: 0
    unit: dB
    
  - identifier: osc
    title: Oscillation
    type: float
    description: >
      Oscillation can be useful to make the image move back and forth during 
      long periods of sound.
      A value of 0 specifies no oscillation.
    mutable: yes
    readonly: no
    default: 5
    minimum: 0
    unit: Hz
    
  - identifier: color.*
    title: Light Color
    type: color
    description: |
      The color of the light.
      
      Multiple colors can be specified with incrementing suffixes to cause the
      waveform to be drawn in a circular gradient. color.1 is the inside of the 
      circle. Subsequent colors will produce a gradient toward the outside.
      
      By default, the filter has one color defined:
      
          color.1=0xffffffff"
          
      This results in the image being lightened.
      
      To create a gradient, define more colors:
      
          color.2=green color.3=0x77777777 color.4=0x00000000
      
      A color value is a hexadecimal representation of RGB plus alpha channel 
      as 0xrrggbbaa. Colors can also be the words: white, black, red, green,
      or blue. You can also use a HTML-style color values #rrggbb or #aarrggbb.

  - identifier: rect
    title: Rectangle
    description: >
      Defines the rectangle that the color should be drawn in.
      
      Format is: "X Y W H".
      
      X, Y, W, H are assumed to be pixel units unless they have the suffix '%'.
    type: rect
    default: "0 0 100% 100%"
    readonly: no
    mutable: yes
    animation: yes

  - identifier: window_size
    title: Window Size
    type: integer
    description: >
      The number of samples that the FFT will be performed on. If
      window_size is less than the number of samples in a frame, extra samples 
      will be ignored. If window_size is more than the number of samples in a 
      frame, samples will be buffered from previous frames to fill the window.
      The buffering is performed as a sliding window so that the most recent 
      samples are always transformed.
    mutable: no
    readonly: no
    default: 2048
