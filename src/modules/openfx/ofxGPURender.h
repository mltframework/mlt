/** @page ofxOpenGLRender OpenGL Acceleration of Rendering

@section ofxOpenGLRenderIntro Introduction

The OfxOpenGLRenderSuite allows image effects to use OpenGL commands
(hopefully backed by a GPU) to accelerate rendering
of their outputs. The basic scheme is simple....
  - An effect indicates it wants to use OpenGL acceleration by setting the
    ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLRenderSupported flag on its descriptor
  - A host indicates it supports OpenGL acceleration by setting
    ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLRenderSupported on its descriptor
  - In an effect's ::kOfxImageEffectActionGetClipPreferences action, an
    effect indicates what clips it will be loading images from onto the GPU's
    memory during an effect's ::kOfxImageEffectActionRender action.

@section ofxOpenGLRenderHouseKeeping OpenGL House Keeping

If a host supports OpenGL rendering then it flags this with the string
property ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLRenderSupported on its descriptor property
set. Effects that cannot run without OpenGL support should examine this in
::kOfxActionDescribe action and return a ::kOfxStatErrMissingHostFeature
status flag if it is not set to "true".

Effects flag to a host that they support OpenGL rendering by setting the
string property ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLRenderSupported on their effect
descriptor during the ::kOfxActionDescribe action. Effects can work in three
ways....
  - purely on CPUs without any OpenGL support at all, in which case they
    should set ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLRenderSupported to be "false" (the
    default),
  - on CPUs but with optional OpenGL support, in which case they should set
    ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLRenderSupported to be "true",
  - only with OpenGL support, in which case they should set
    ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLRenderSupported to be "needed".

Hosts can examine this flag and respond to it appropriately.

Effects can use OpenGL accelerated rendering during the following
action...
  - ::kOfxImageEffectActionRender

If an effect has indicated that it optionally supports OpenGL acceleration,
it should check the property ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLEnabled
passed as an in argument to the following actions,
  - ::kOfxImageEffectActionRender
  - ::kOfxImageEffectActionBeginSequenceRender
  - ::kOfxImageEffectActionEndSequenceRender

If this property is set to 0, then it should not attempt to use any calls to
the OpenGL suite or OpenGL calls whilst rendering.


@section ofxOpenGLRenderGettingTextures Getting Images as Textures

An effect could fetch an image into memory from a host via the standard
Image Effect suite "clipGetImage" call, then create an OpenGL
texture from that. However as several buffer copies and various other bits
of house keeping may need to happen to do this, it is more
efficient for a host to create the texture directly.

The OfxOpenGLRenderSuiteV1::clipLoadTexture function does this. The
arguments and semantics are similar to the
OfxImageEffectSuiteV2::clipGetImage function, with a few minor changes.

The effect is passed back a property handle describing the texture. Once the
texture is finished with, this should be disposed
of via the OfxOpenGLRenderSuiteV1::clipFreeTexture function, which will also
delete the associated OpenGL texture (for source clips).

The returned handle has a set of properties on it, analogous to the
properties returned on the image handle by
OfxImageEffectSuiteV2::clipGetImage. These are:
    - ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLTextureIndex
    - ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLTextureTarget
    - ::kOfxImageEffectPropPixelDepth
    - ::kOfxImageEffectPropComponents
    - ::kOfxImageEffectPropPreMultiplication
    - ::kOfxImageEffectPropRenderScale
    - ::kOfxImagePropPixelAspectRatio
    - ::kOfxImagePropBounds
    - ::kOfxImagePropRegionOfDefinition
    - ::kOfxImagePropRowBytes
    - ::kOfxImagePropField
    - ::kOfxImagePropUniqueIdentifier

The main difference between this and an image handle is that the
::kOfxImagePropData property is replaced by the
kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLTextureIndex property.
This integer property should be cast to a GLuint and is the index to use for
the OpenGL texture.
Next to texture handle the texture target enumerator is given in
kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLTextureTarget

Note, because the image is being directly loaded into a texture by the host
it need not obey the Clip Preferences action to remap the image to the pixel
depth the effect requested.

@section ofxOpenGLRenderOutput Render Output Directly with OpenGL

Effects can use the graphics context as they see fit. They may be doing
several render passes with fetch back from the card to main memory
via 'render to texture' mechanisms interleaved with passes performed on the
CPU. The effect must leave output on the graphics card in the provided output
image texture buffer.

The host will create a default OpenGL viewport that is the size of the
render window passed to the render action. The following
code snippet shows how the viewport should be rooted at the bottom left of
the output texture.

\verbatim
  // set up the OpenGL context for the render to texture
  ...

  // figure the size of the render window
  int dx = renderWindow.x2 - renderWindow.x1;
  int dy = renderWindow.y2 - renderWindow.y2;

  // setup the output viewport
  glViewport(0, 0, dx, dy);

\endverbatim

Prior to calling the render action the host may also choose to
bind the output texture as the current color buffer (render target), or they
may defer doing this until clipLoadTexture is called for the output clip.

After this, it is completely up to the effect to choose what OpenGL
operations to render with, including projections and so on.

@section ofxOpenGLRenderContext OpenGL Current Context

The host is only required to make the OpenGL context current (e.g.,
using wglMakeCurrent, for Windows) during the following actions:

   - ::kOfxImageEffectActionRender
   - ::kOfxImageEffectActionBeginSequenceRender
   - ::kOfxImageEffectActionEndSequenceRender
   - ::kOfxActionOpenGLContextAttached
   - ::kOfxActionOpenGLContextDetached

For the first 3 actions, Render through EndSequenceRender, the host is only
required to set the OpenGL context if ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenGLEnabled is
set.  In other words, a plug-in should not expect the OpenGL context to be
current for other OFX calls, such as ::kOfxImageEffectActionDescribeInContext.

/** @page ofxOpenCLRender OpenCL Acceleration of Rendering

@section ofxOpenCLRenderIntro Introduction

The OpenCL extension enables plug-ins to use OpenCL commands (typically backed by a GPU) to accelerate rendering of their outputs. The basic scheme is simple....
- an plug-in indicates it wants to use OpenCL acceleration by setting the ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLSupported (Images) and/or ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLRenderSupported (Buffers) flags on it's descriptor.
- a host indicates it supports OpenCL acceleration by setting ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLSupported (Images) and/or ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLRenderSupported (Buffers) on it's descriptor.
- the host decides when to use OpenCL, and sets the ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLEnabled property on the BeginRender/Render/EndRender calls to indicate this.
- when OpenCL Images are being used (::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLSupported) the clip image property ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLImage will be set and non-null.
- when OpenCL Buffers are being used (::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLRenderSupported) the clip image property ::kOfxImagePropData will be set and non-null.

@section ofxOpenCLRenderDiscoveryAndEnabling Discovery and Enabling

If a host supports OpenCL rendering then it flags with the string property ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLSupported (Images) and/or
::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLRenderSupported (Buffers) on its descriptor property set. Effects that cannot run without OpenCL support
should examine this in ::kOfxActionDescribe action and return a ::kOfxStatErrMissingHostFeature status flag if it is not set to "true".

Effects flag to a host that they support OpenCL rendering by setting the string property ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLSupported (Images)
and/or ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLRenderSupported (Buffers) on their effect descriptor during the ::kOfxActionDescribe action.
Effects can work in two ways....
- purely on CPUs without any OpenCL support at all, in which case they should set ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLSupported (Images) and ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLRenderSupported (Buffers) to be "false" (the default),
- on CPUs but with optional OpenCL support, in which case they should set ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLSupported (Images) and/or ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLRenderSupported (Buffers) to be "true"

Host may support just OpenCL Images, just OpenCL Buffers, or both, as indicated by which of these two properties they set "true".
Likewise plug-ins may support just OpenCL Images, just OpenCL Buffers, or both, as indicated by which of these two properties they set "true".
If both host and plug-in support both, it is up to the host which it uses. Typically, it will be based on what it uses natively (to avoid an extra copy operation).
If a plug-in supports both, it must use ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLImage to determine if Images or Buffers are being used for a given render action.

Effects can use OpenCL render only during the following action:
- ::kOfxImageEffectActionRender

If a plug-in has indicated that it optionally supports OpenCL acceleration, it should check the property ::kOfxImageEffectPropOpenCLEnabled
passed as an in argument to the following actions,
- ::kOfxImageEffectActionRender
- ::kOfxImageEffectActionBeginSequenceRender
- ::kOfxImageEffectActionEndSequenceRender

If this property is set to 0, then it must not attempt to use OpenCL while rendering.
If this property is set to 1, then it must use OpenCL buffers or images while rendering.

If a call using OpenCL rendering fails, the host may re-attempt using CPU buffers instead, but this is not required, and might not be efficient.

@section ofxOpenCLRenderVersion OpenCL platform and device versions and feature support

Assume an in-order command queue. Do not assume a profiling command queue.

Effects should target OpenCL 1.1 API and OpenCL C kernel language support. Only minimum required features required
in OpenCL 1.1 should be used (for example, see "5.3.2.1 Minimum List of Supported Image Formats" for the list
of image types which can be expected to be supported across all devices). If you have specific requirements
for features beyond these minimums, you will need to check the device (e.g., using clGetDeviceInfo with
CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS) to see if your feature is available, and have a fallback if it's not.

Temporary buffers and images should not be kept past the render action. A separate extension for host managed caching is in the works.

Do not retain OpenCL objects without a matching release within the render action.

@section ofxOpenCLRenderMultipleDevices Multiple OpenCL Devices

This is very important: The host may support multiple OpenCL devices. Therefore the plug-in should keep a separate set of kernels per OpenCL content (e.g., using a map).
The OpenCL context can be found from the command queue using clGetCommandQueueInfo with CL_QUEUE_CONTEXT.
Failure to do this will cause crashes or incorrect results when the host switches to another OpenCL device.
