    title: Octave Shift
    type: float
    description: >
      The octave shift. This is the octave shift of the source frequency. For
      example, a shift of +1 would double the frequency; -1 would halve the
      frequency and 0 would leave the pitch unaffected. To put this in frequency
      terms, a frequency shift f (where f greater than one for upwards shift and
      less than one for downwards) is: o = log(f) / log(2).
      
      Ignored if pitchscale is set.

    title: Pitch Scale
    type: float
    description: >
      The pitch scaling ratio. This is the ratio of target frequency to source
      frequency. For example, a ratio of 2.0 would shift up by one octave; 0.5
      down by one octave; or 1.0 leave the pitch unaffected. To put this in
      musical terms, a pitch scaling ratio corresponding to a shift of o
      octaves (where o is positive for an upwards shift and
      negative for downwards) is: f = pow(2.0, o).
      
      Overrides octaveshift.
