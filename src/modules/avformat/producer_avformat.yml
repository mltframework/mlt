notes: >
  This service uses mlt_cache to prevent many simultaneous, open instances
  of libavformat and libavcodec contexts, file handles, and threads in memory
  at the same time. Not only does it save on RAM usage, but kernels enforce
  maximum open file handles and threads per process. Without caching, large
  projects could easily run into these limits. The default producer cache
  size is in mlt_cache at size 4. When using mlt_multitrack, the size is
  adjusted automatically to be the number of tracks plus one if at least 4.
  This makes it rather dynamic and automatic; however, there are some service
  graph configurations or authoring scenarios that do not exclusively use the
  multitrack for multi-layer operations and may need a larger avformat
  producer cache size. One can set the environment variable
  MLT_AVFORMAT_PRODUCER_CACHE to a number to override and increase the size of
  this cache (or to lower it for limited use cases and seeking to minimize RAM).

bugs:
  - Audio sync discrepancy with some content.
  - Not all libavformat supported formats are seekable.
  - >
    Seeking is not always accurate. Sometimes it doesn't seek to I-frames so you
    may get junk for a few frames.
  - >
    More than 2 channels of audio more than 16 bits is not supported.

parameters:

    argument: yes
    title: File/URL
    type: string
    description: |
      A file name specification or URL in the form:
      [{protocol}|{format}]:{resource}[?{format-parameter}[&{format-parameter}...]]
      For example, video4linux2:/dev/video1?width=320&height=240
      Note: on the bash command line, '&' must be escaped as '\&'.
      If you need '?' in the resource name it must be escaped as '\?'.
      Use 'f-list' to see a list of supported file formats.
      Use 'vcodec-list' to see a list of supported video decoders.
      Use 'acodec-list' to see a list of supported audio decoders.

      channels on one audio track.

    title: Number of images cache
    type: integer
    description: >
      By default, this producer caches images to facilitate YADIF deinterlace,
      which needs previous and next frames. Also, caching helps with frame-
      stepping within a player. The default number of images cached is supplied
      by the MLT framework, which is currently 4, but you can override it
      with this property. You can also disable caching by setting it to 0.
      If you are using parallel processing with YADIF deinterlacing, then
      you might need to increase caching to prevent inadvertent backward seeks.
      One can also set this value globally for all instances of avformat by
      setting the environment variable MLT_AVFORMAT_CACHE.
