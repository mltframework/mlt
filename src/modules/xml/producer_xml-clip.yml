  This producer encapsulates a producer generated by the XML producer module.
  The encapsulated producer will be operated at the profile specified in the
  XML file. This producer will ignore any profile passed into the init routine
  and will use a profile generated from the XML.
  This producer is only suitible in a project that has an exact match for the
  XML profile, or encapsulated in a chain where the frame rate can be adapted.
