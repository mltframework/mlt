      The gradient color stops.

      A set of pairs that each describe a point in the gradient. A pair consists
      on a color and a position with a separator in between them.

      By default, the filter has a gradient that goes from black to white.

          stop.1='#ff000000 0.0' stop.2='#ffffffff 1.0'

      This results in the image turned into black and white.

      The gradient can hold up to 32 colors. On repeated stop positions only the
      first one is taken.
