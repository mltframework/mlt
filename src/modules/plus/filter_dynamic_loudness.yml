description: Dynamically correct audio loudness as recommended by EBU R128.
notes: >
  This filter adjusts the level of the audio based on the loudness of the input.
  It performs loudness measurement over a specified sliding window of time. 
  Then, it adjusts the gain on the output based on the difference between the 
  measured loudness and the target loudness in order to achieve the desired 
  loudness.
  
parameters:
  - identifier: target_loudness
    title: Target Program Loudness
    type: float
    description: >
      The target program loudness in LUFS (Loudness Units Full Scale).

    description: >
      The program loudness measured on the input over the duration of the 
      window.
    readonly: yes
    unit: LUFS

  - identifier: out_gain
    title: Output Gain
    type: float
    description: >
      The amount of gain applied to the last frame. Updated with each new frame.

  - identifier: reset_count
    title: Reset Count
    type: integer
    description: >
      The number of times the filter has reset the loudness measurement. The 
      measurement is reset whenever the filter detects a discontinuity in the 
      frame sequence. It also resets when it detects that the producer has 
      changed.
    readonly: yes
