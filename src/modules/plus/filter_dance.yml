  An audio visualization filter that moves the image around proportional to the 
  magnitude of the audio spectrum.
  
parameters:
  - identifier: frequency_low
    title: Low Frequency
    type: integer
    description: >
      The low end of the frequency range to be used to influence the image 
      motion.
    mutable: yes
    readonly: no
    default: 20
    unit: Hz
    
  - identifier: frequency_high
    title: High Frequency
    type: integer
    description: >
      The high end of the frequency range to be used to influence the image 
      motion.
    mutable: yes
    readonly: no
    default: 20000
    unit: Hz
    
  - identifier: threshold
    title: Level Threshold
    type: float
    description: >
      The minimum amplitude of sound that must occur within the frequency range
      to cause the image to move.

    default: -30
    minimum: -100
    maximum: 0
    unit: dB
    
  - identifier: osc
    title: Oscillation
    type: float
    description: >
      Oscillation can be useful to make the image move back and forth during 
      long periods of sound.
      A value of 0 specifies no oscillation.
    mutable: yes
    readonly: no
    default: 5
    minimum: 0
    unit: Hz
    
  - identifier: initial_zoom
    title: Initial Zoom
    type: float
    description: |
      The amount to zoom the image before any motion occurs. This can be used to
      avoid black on the sides of the image when it moves.
        100% = no zoom
      < 100% = zoom out (make the image smaller)
      > 100% = zoom in (make the image larger)

  - identifier: zoom
    title: Zoom
    type: float

    maximum: 100
    unit: '%'
    
  - identifier: left
    title: Left
    type: float
    description: |
      The amount that the audio affects the left offset of the image.

    unit: '%'
    
  - identifier: right
    title: Right
    type: float
    description: |
      The amount that the audio affects the right offset of the image.
        0% = no right offset

    title: Up
    type: float
    description: |
      The amount that the audio affects the upward offset of the image.
        0% = no upward offset
      > 0% = Image will move up with more sound
    mutable: yes
    readonly: no
    default: 0
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 100
    unit: '%'
    
  - identifier: down
    title: Down
    type: float
    description: |
      The amount that the audio affects the downward offset of the image.
        0% = no downward offset
      > 0% = Image will move down with more sound
    mutable: yes
    readonly: no
    default: 0
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 100
    unit: '%'
    
  - identifier: clockwise
    title: Clockwise
    type: float
    description: |
      The amount that the audio affects the clockwise rotation of the image.
        0% = no clockwise rotation
      > 0% = Image will rotate clockwise with more sound
    mutable: yes
    readonly: no
    default: 0
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 360
    unit: degrees
    
  - identifier: counterclockwise
    title: Counterclockwise
    type: float
    description: |
      The amount that the audio affects the counterclockwise rotation of the image.

    mutable: yes
    readonly: no
    default: 0
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 360
    unit: degrees

  - identifier: window_size
    title: Window Size
    type: integer
    description: >
      The number of samples that the FFT will be performed on. If
      window_size is less than the number of samples in a frame, extra samples 
      will be ignored. If window_size is more than the number of samples in a 
      frame, samples will be buffered from previous frames to fill the window.
      The buffering is performed as a sliding window so that the most recent 
      samples are always transformed.

    readonly: no
    default: 2048
