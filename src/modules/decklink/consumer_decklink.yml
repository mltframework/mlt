      This controls the amount of buffering in the DeckLink driver/library.
      Increase this if you get video tearing or choppy audio. However, as
      you increase the amount, you increase the risk of audio and video
      becoming out of synchronization.

      Keying is the process of compositing MLT output over a live SDI input.
      The alpha channel of the MLT video controls the transparent areas, and
      the keyer supports alpha-blending. You can not control the compositing
      rectangle. Rather, the entire MLT output overlays the entire video
      input. Therefore, you must use MLT's compositing services to control
      the size and position.

      This controls the level of blending between the key and the input video.
      1 is fully opaque and something near 0 is transparent. However, absolute
      0 is considered as "not supplied" and also fully opaque. 0.5 is an
      evenly balanced blending of the key and input video.
