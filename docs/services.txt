	avformat

	    Description

	        ffmpeg libavformat based producer for video and audio.

	    Constructor Argument

	        'file' - a filename specification or URL in the form:
	                 [{protocol}|{format}]:{resource}[?{format-parameter}[&{format-parameter}...]]
	                 For example, video4linux:/dev/video1?width:320&height:240
	                 Note: on the bash command line, & must be escaped as '\&'.
	                 Also, note the use of ':' instead of '=' for parameters.
	                 Use 'ffmpeg -formats' to see a list of supported protocols 
	                 and formats.
	                 
	    Details
	    
	        Format parameters only appear to be useful with 'video4linux' or
	        'audio_device' formats. For 'video4linux' the parameters are
	        width, height, frame_rate, frame_rate_base, and standard (ntsc|pal).
	        For 'audio_device' the parameters are channels and sample_rate.

	    Initialisation Properties

	        int video_index - index of video stream to use (-1 is off)
	        int audio_index - index of audio stream to use (-1 is off)
	        int in - in point
	        int out - out point

	    Read Only Properties

	        string resource - file location
	        double fps - this is fixed at 25 for PAL currently
	        double source_fps - the framerate of the resource
	        double aspect_ratio - sample aspect ratio of the resource
	                            - this is determined on every frame read

	    Dependencies

	        ffmpeg must be configured as --enable-shared and installed prior
	        to compilation of mlt.

	    Known Bugs

	        Audio sync discrepancy with some content.
	        Not all libavformat supported formats are seekable.
	        Ogg Vorbis is currently broken.
	        MPEG seeking is inaccurate - doesn't seek to i-frames so you may
	        get junk for a few frames.
	        RAW DV seeking not supported.
	        Fails to play beyond first frame of video of sources with PTS not
	        starting at 0 (video4linux).

	fezzik

	    Description

	        A friendly giant that likes to rhyme and throw rocks

	    Constructor Argument

	        'file'    - a filename specification:
	                  [{mlt-service}:]{resource} | {mlt-service}
	                - can also be the name of a producer service that can
	                  accept the resource specified post construction.

	    Initialisation Properties

	        int in - in point
	        int out - out point
	        + all producer initialising properties

	    Read Only Properties

	        string resource - file location
	        + all producer read only properties

	    Details

	        This producer has two roles:

	        1. it handles the mappings of all file names to the other
	        producers;
	        2. it attaches normalising filters (rescale, resize and resample)
	        to the producers (when necessary).

	        This producer simplifies many aspects of use. Essentially, it
	        ensures that a consumer will receive images and audio precisely as
	        they request them. 

	    Dependencies

	        all.

	    Known Bugs

	        None.

	pango

	    Description

	        A title generator that uses the Pango international text layout
	        and Freetype2 font renderer.

	    Constructor Argument

	        string file - a text file containing Pango markup, see:
	        http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/pango/PangoMarkupFormat.html
	                    - requires xml-like encoding special chars from: 
	                      <, >, &   -to-   &lt;, &gt;, &amp;
	                      
	    Details
	    
	        Supplying a filename with extension ".txt" causes the Fezzik 
	        producer to load with pango. If the filename begins with "+" the 
	        pango producer interprets the filename as pango text. This is a
	        shortcut to embed titles in inigo commands. For westley, it is 
	        recommended that you embed the title text in the property value.
	        
	        Pango has builtin scaling. It will rescale the originally rendered
	        title to whatever the consumer requests. Therefore, it will lose
	        its aspect ratio if so requested, and it is up to the consumer to
	        request a proper width and height that maintains the image aspect.

	    Initialisation Properties

	        int in - in point
	        int out - out point

	    Mutable Properties

	        string markup - a string containing Pango markup see:
	        http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/pango/PangoMarkupFormat.html
	                      - requires xml-like encoding special chars from: 
	                        <, >, &   -to-   &lt;, &gt;, &amp;
	        string fgcolour - an RGBA colour specification of the text 
	                          (i.e. 0xrrggbbaa)
	        string bgcolour - an RGBA colour of the background rectangle
	        string align - paragraph alignment: left, centre, right
	                     - also, numbers 0, 1 and 2 can be used respectively.
	        int pad - the number of pixels to pad the background rectangle 
	                  beyond edges of text. default 0.
	        string markup - see constructor argument
	        string text - non-markup string in UTF-8 encoding (can contain 
	                      markup chars un-encoded)
	        string font - the default typeface to use when not using markup.
	                      default "Sans 48". FreeType2 renders at 72 dpi.
	        string encoding - the text encoding type of the input if not UTF-8.
	                        - see 'iconv --list' for a list of possible inputs.

	        int width - the last requested scaled image width.
	        int height - the last requested scaled image height.

	    Dependencies

	        libglib-2.0, libgobject-2.0, libgmodule-2.0, libfontconfig.

	    Known Bugs

	        The foreground and background Pango markup span attributes are not
	        supported.

	pixbuf

	    Description

	        A still graphics to video generator using gdk-pixbuf

	                 animation. The file sequence ends when numeric 
	                 discontinuity >100.
	               - If filename contains "/.all.", suffix with an extension to 
	                 load all pictures with matching extension from a directory.
	               - If filename contains the string "<svg", then pixbuf tries
	                 to load the filename as inline SVG XML, which is convenient
	                 for inigo commands.
	                 
	    Details
	    
	        Pixbuf has builtin scaling. It will rescale the originally rendered
	        title to whatever the consumer requests. Therefore, it will lose
	        its aspect ratio if so requested, and it is up to the consumer to

	ppm
	
	    Description

	        Reads a stream of contiguous PPM images.
	        
	    Constructor Argument

	westley

	    Description

	        Construct a service network from an XML description.
	        See docs/westley.txt.

	    Constructor Argument

	        URL - an XML text file containing westley XML (schema/DTD pending)
	            - Since westley files can be parameterised, the URL syntax is:
	              {file-name}[?{param-name}{'='|':'}{param-value}[&{param-name}{'='|':'}{param-value}...]]
	              A colon is allowed instead of an equal sign to pacify inigo,
	              who tokenises anything with an equal sign as a property 
	              setting. Also, when running inigo from the shell, beware of
	              the '?' and shell filename expansion. You can surround the URL
	              with single quotations to prevent expansion. Finally, fezzik
	              will fail to match the filename when you use parameters, so
	              preface the url with 'westley:' to force fezzik to load with
	              the westley service.

	        Non-referenced producers and playlists are not destroyed until the 
	        network is destroyed.
	        A referenced producer or playlist must appear before the reference.
	        A filter that occurs before a producer has been defined causes a 
	        segfault.

	vorbis

	    Description

	        OGG Vorbis file reader.

	    Constructor Argument

	        'file' - file to use (only .ogg supported at the moment)

	resize
	
	    Description

	        Image scaling and padding and field order adjustment.
	            
	    Details
	    
	        Normally resize is used to pad the producer's
	        output to what the consumer has requested after an upstream rescale
	        filter first scales the image to maximise usage of the image area.
	        This filter also adjusts the field order to lower field first
	        if the frame property "top_field_first" has been set to 1.
	        Therefore, when done, it sets the top_field_first to 0.
	        This filter is automatically invoked by Fezzik as part of image
	        sample aspect ratio normalisation.

	    Constructor Argument

	        gain - a string containing one of:
	             - a floating point value of the gain adjustment
	             - a numeric value with the suffix "dB" to adjust in terms of decibels
	             - "normalise" to normalise the volume to the target amplitude -12dBFS
	        
	    Initialisation Properties
	    
	        int in - in point
	        int out - out point
	        int window - the number of video frames over which to smooth normalisation.
	                     defaults to 75.

	    Mutable Properties

	        string gain - same as constructor argument above

	        string normalise - normalise the volume to the amplitude:
	            - a numeric value with the suffix "dB" to set amplitude in decibels
	            - a floating point value of the relative volume
	            - an unspecified value uses the default -12dBFS

	        string limiter - limit all samples above:
	            - a numeric value with the suffix "dB"
	            - a floating point value ( dB = 20 * log10(x) )
	            - an unspecified value uses the default -6dBFS

	        double max_gain - a floating point or decibel value of the maximum gain that
	            can be applied during normalisation.
	            - an unspecified value uses the default 20dB

	        string end - a gain value just like the gain property above.
	                     This causes the gain to be interpolated from 'gain' to 'end'
	                     over the duration.

	        int window - the size of the normalising smoothing buffer in video frame units.
	                   - the smoothing buffer prevents erratic gain changes.
	                   - the default value is 75 video frames.

	composite
	
	    Description

	        A key-framable alpha-channel compositor for two frames.
	        
	    Details
	    
	        Performs dissolves and luma wipes in addition to alpha compositing.
	        
	        By default, the aspect ratio of the B frame is respected and the
	        size portion of the geometry specification simply defines a 
	        bounding rectangle.
	    
	        This performs field-based rendering unless the A frame property
	        "progressive" or "consumer_progressive" or the transition property
	        "progressive" is set to 1.

	luma
	
	    Description

	        A generic dissolve and wipe transition processor.

	    Details

	        luma gets its name
	        from how it uses a grayscale "map" file. As the luma value varies
	        over time, a threshold filter is applied to the map to determine
	        what parts of frame A vs. frame B to show. It reads PGM files
	        up to 16 bits! Alternatively, it can use the first frame from any
	        producer that outputs yuv, but it will be limited to the luma
	        gamut of 220 values.
	        This performs field-based rendering unless the A frame property
	        "progressive" or "consumer_progressive" or the transition property
	        "progressive" is set to 1.
	    
	    Constructor Argument
