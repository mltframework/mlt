Version 6.2.0 - April 20, 2016

There are no framework changes in this release. The major announcement is the
introduction of support for libavfilter! This is still a work-in-progress.
It is limited to FFmpeg 2.3 and up, and there are a number of filters that
are black-listed because they are known to not integrate with MLT, which is
not a full libav* environment or simple wrapper for it. There are likey
avfilters that are not yet black-listed but might not work because they
have not been completely tested. Also, they do not support MLT's keyframable
property animation nor its frame-threaded parallelism due to architectural
or integration limitations. However, some avfilters are slice-threaded
(internal parallelism), and that works. Finally, libavfilter filtergraph
syntax is not supported either.

All of the supported libavfilters are exposed as MLT filters beginning with
the prefix "avfilter." All of the avfilter parameters are exposed as MLT
properties with the "av." prefix to prevent clashes with MLT properties.
You can run `melt -query filters` to see the new avfilters, and
`melt -query filter=avfilter.rotate`, for example, to view generated
documentation for an individual filter.

Here is a list of notable fixes and enhancements in this release:
  * Added support for libavfilter to avformat module.
  * Added auto-rotate support to avformat producer.
  * Added animated GIF preset for avformat consumer.
  * Prevent serializing and deserializing mlt_type property to xml module.

  * Added loudness_meter filter to plus module.
  * Qt 5 fixes for kdenlivetitle producer.
  * Added gradients and text shadows to kdenlivetitle producer.
  * Added support for building rtaudio against external build of lib.
  * Upgraded bundled RtAudio to v4.1.2.
  * Added status parameters to ladspa producer and filters.
  * Added 5.1 surround to stereo downmix to audiochannels filter in core module.
  * Fixed compiling SWIG bindings for Ruby 2.0.

regression on videos that use full-range colorspaces such as yuv420p.

Version 0.8.0 - June 1, 2012

The minor version is increased due to the addition of time properties!
The soname version increased in the process because some mlt_property

Since FFmpeg forked and there were a few releases, there is no recommended
version at this time. With that said, there were changes to accommodate the
API changes with some moderate testing of the 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 series
releases of both FFmpeg and Libav.


Version 0.7.2 - May 1, 2011

This is a minor release to fix a few things between the 0.7.0 release
and the release of Kdenlive 0.8. I recommend Kdenlive v0.8 users to
upgrade to this version of Mlt. Beyond that there are some exciting
additions to the Blackmagic Design DeckLink plugin!

Version 0.6.0 - January 1, 2011

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is 0.6.1.
There were quite a few enhancements and changes including a minor interface
change. Therefore, this release gets a jump in the versioning.

Framework
 * mlt_profile
   - Added (Y'CbCr) colorspace attribute.
   - Added mlt_profile_clone().

Version 0.5.10 - September 13, 2010

This is a quick followup to the 0.5.8 release to address an issue I want to
address immediately. I noticed an extra unconditional colorspace conversion
to and from RGB was added for all YCbCr (YUV) video sources. In addition, I
have enabled the avcolor_space filter on OS X since it works now.


Version 0.5.8 - September 12, 2010

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is 0.6.
This is a maintenance release to address some bugs that appeared
thus far in the 0.5.x series. Beyond that is a few enhancements:

* Added EXIF-based auto-rotation of images to pixbuf and qimage producers.
* Improved quality of libswscale-based image conversion and scaling.
* Added channelswap and panner audio filters; panner also does balance.
* Improve audio waveform and add audiowave video filter.
* Enhanced luma filter to work with animated filters such as affine.
* Automatically crop 8 bottom lines of 1088 source in a 16:9 project
  (common in Canon EOS digital cameras).
* Added support for inline images in kdenlivetitler.


Version 0.5.6 - June 20, 2010

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is 0.6.

this far in the 0.5.x series. Beyond that it a few enhancements:

* Added interpolation to the affine transition and filter.
* Added multi-track audio encoding to avformat consumer.
* Added interlaced field rendering to kdenlivetitle producer.


Version 0.5.4 - April 19, 2010

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is SVN r21322.
This is another maintenance release to address some bugs that appeared
this far in the 0.5.x series. Beyond that it adds two things that only
very specific users will see:

* Added C# (ECMA CLR) binding (not enabled by default).
* Linsys SDI consumer now configures itself from MLT profile.


Version 0.5.2 - March 10, 2010

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is SVN r21322.
This is a minor maintenance release, but it is interesting because it now
enables usage of libswscale as the default choice for image scaling,
image format conversion, and color space conversion. That gives better
quality and performance. In addition, there are some improvements in the
sdl_preview consumer to make it suitable for use in OpenShot 1.1. Other
things:

* Fixed mlt++/MltFilteredProducer
* Fixed playing to the end in Kdenlive (mantis bug 1207)
* Fixed crash load uncompressed video
* Fixed compiling yadif for non-sse2 builds


Version 0.5.0 - February 15, 2010

technologies!

* avformat producer:
  - added decoding H.264 with NVIDIA VDPAU

    This is automatically detected and enabled. You can disable this by
	setting environment variable MLT_NO_VDPAU=1 or property novdpau=1.
  - added caching of FFmpeg contexts and decoded images
    This allows large numbers of clips in a project avoiding limitations
	with number of threads and file descriptors permitted per process.
