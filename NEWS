MLT Release Notes
-----------------

Version 7.32.0

Framework

  * Fixed text outline had sharp angles in `kdenlivetitle` producer.
  * Fixed default gamma to be Rec. 709 for 10-bit Y'CbCr from `movit` module.
  * Added support for HLG gamma to `movit` module (requires ddennedy/movit fork).

  * Fixed consumer properties (e.g. `channels`) missing on `qglsl` consumer
    injected by the `xml` producer.


Version 7.30.0

Framework
  * Fixed `Mlt::Producer::set_creation_time()` not exported on i686.
  * Fixed `Mlt::Properties::set(int64_t)` symbol version.
  * Fixed `mlt_factory_init()` on Linux/BSD may fail to initialize when
    compiled with `-DRELOCATABLE`.
  * Added generic non-drop-frame timecode in `mlt_property.c`.
    Previously, it was only done for 30000/1001 and 60000/1001 frame rates,
    but 24000/1001 is especially important as well.
  * Added support for MLT XML embedded in chains.
    This, along with `xml-clip` producer handles mismatching frame rate
    between parent and child producers and facilites time-affecting links on
    the child.
  * Added `mlt_image_full_range(const char *color_range)` where any of the
    following strings return true (1): `full`, `jpeg`, `pc`.

Modules
  * Added `xml-clip` producer.
  * Fixed link `in` and `out` properties arenot serialized in the `xml` consumer.
  * Added `hslprimaries` and `hslrange` filters to the `plus` module.
  * Added a `gradientmap` filter to the `plus` module.
  * Fixed `avfilter` audio filters with FFmpeg 7.
  * Fixed incorrect frame rate for AVCHD (and possibly others) in `avformat`.
  * Fixed `window_id` property in consumer `sdl2` by using
    `SDL_CreateWindowFrom()`, especially important for embedding in GTK+ or Qt.
  * Fixed text not rendering in transition `vqm` since Qt 6.
  * Added `decimals` keyword to `gpstext` filter and move `RAW` keyword check.
  * Fixed `time_offset` property handling in `gpstext` filter.
  * Fixed reading and writing SRT files with unicode in the path.
  * Fixed `subtitle_feed` filter on producers with an in point > 0.
  * Fixed opaque alpha channels become translucent in `luma` transition.
  * Fixed a crash in the `mix` transition with `consumer` producer.
  * Fixed `freeze` filter freezing too much.
  * Fixed `avfilter.fillborders` with preview scaling.
  * Fixed non-proportional scaling in `qtblend` transition and filter.
  * Fixed `avfilter` color distortion with `mlt_image_rgb` and `mlt_image_rgba`.
  * Extended support for `colorspace=2020` consumer propeerty and the BT.2020
    colorspace in the `avformat` producer and consumer.
    This does not imply HDR, which is signaled through a `color_trc` property.
  * Added support for `mlt_image_yuv420p10`, `mlt_image_yuv444p10`, and
    `mlt_image_yuv422p16` in `avfilter`, `swscale`, and `rescale` filters.
    This facilitates using these pixel formats end-to-end when using only
    FFmpeg producers, certain avfilters, and `avformat` consumer.
    This means it is possible to do 10-bit end-to-end on the CPU when being
    careful to select compatible components and options to avoid conversions.
    One can pass-through HDR; however, you must set the `color_trc` and
    `pix_fmt` properties on the `avformat` consumer (see `ffmpeg -h full` for
    these values). The `avformat` consumer automatically converts MLT
    `colorspace` (integer value) to FFmpeg's `colorspace` and `color_primaries`
    (unless explicit) options.

Other
  * Cleaned up the examples in `src/swig`.
  * Changed the `x264-medium` preset to a higher quality.

      a work-in-progress).
  * Added support for WebP animation to `qimage` producer.
  * Added `gps_graphic` filter to the `qt` module.
  * Added the `format` property in each producer's get_frame method to indicate
    the producer's default/preferred mlt_image_format to facilitate

Version 6.26.1

This version fixes a major regression in the avformat producer to read from
network URLs.


Version 6.26.0

This is the last planned release of major version 6. Version 7 will be released
soon and introduce some minor API breakage while removing deprecations.
The main new feature in this version is hardware-accellerated decoding!
However, this is a basic implementation: It always returns the uncompressed
video to the CPU memory with no pipelining to filters. Even when coupled with
hardware encoding in the avformat consumer it must transfer the video. Also,
there is no automatic software/CPU fallback and no resource management.

Modules
  * Added support for `hwaccel` query string parameter to the `avformat`
    producer. It accepts the following values:
    vaapi (Linux/BSD), cuda (Linux), videotoolbox (macOS), d3d11va (Windows), dxva2 (Windows)
  * Added support for `hwaccel_device` query string parameter to the `avformat`
    producer. This is only used with vaapi (device path) and cuda, d3d11va, or
    dxva (number).
  * Improved the usage of image slice threading in `frei0r`. This only applies
    when `threads`=0 and only works with some frei0r plugins that you must decide
    yourself.
  * Added an ellipse item to `kdenlivetitle` producer.
  * Added support for PNG and GIF as album art in the `avformat` producer.
  * Added BT.2020 color space metadata to the `avformat` producer.
  * Resolved many FFmpeg deprecations in the `avformat` producer making it possible to support AV1 decoding.
  * Added a `strobe` fitler that periodically makes the alpha channel transparent.
  * Added a new `typewriter` text filter (currently only works with the
    kdenlivetitle producer).
  * Improved sound quality for lower pitch shifts in `rbpitch`.
  * Fixed speed of trick play in the `jack`, `rtaudio`, `sdl_audio`, and `sdl2_audio` consumers.
  * Fixed matrix for independent channels in `swresample` filter.
  * Fixed leading zeros for the `timer` filter.
  * Fixed flickering using `affine` with a `luma` transition.
  * Fixed a crash using RGBA images in the `qimage` producer (regression in v6.22.0).

  * Fixed writing `flac` format file does not set its duration in the `avformat` consumer.
  * Fixed an infinite loop in `rbpitch` filter.
  * Fixed `ttl` in the `qimage` producer.
  * Fixed building with OpenCV 4.5
  * Fixed artifacts with multiple HTML `qtext` filters and frame threading.
  * Deprecated the `start` and `end` properties on the following (use property
    animation instead):
    - brightness
    - panner
    - boxblur
    - wave
    - volume
  * Deprecated the following services:
    - data_show
    - region
    - transition filter
    - autotrack_rectangle
    - motion_est
    - slowmotion

  * Improved documentation of the requirement for C11.
  * The minimum version of FFmpeg is v4.0 and Libav is no longer supported.


Version 6.24.0

This version is mostly fixes plus a few new filters.

Framework

Version 6.2.0 - April 20, 2016

There are no framework changes in this release. The major announcement is the
introduction of support for libavfilter! This is still a work-in-progress.
It is limited to FFmpeg 2.3 and up, and there are a number of filters that
are black-listed because they are known to not integrate with MLT, which is
not a full libav* environment or simple wrapper for it. There are likey
avfilters that are not yet black-listed but might not work because they
have not been completely tested. Also, they do not support MLT's keyframable
property animation nor its frame-threaded parallelism due to architectural
or integration limitations. However, some avfilters are slice-threaded
(internal parallelism), and that works. Finally, libavfilter filtergraph
syntax is not supported either.

All of the supported libavfilters are exposed as MLT filters beginning with
the prefix "avfilter." All of the avfilter parameters are exposed as MLT
properties with the "av." prefix to prevent clashes with MLT properties.
You can run `melt -query filters` to see the new avfilters, and
`melt -query filter=avfilter.rotate`, for example, to view generated
documentation for an individual filter.

Here is a list of notable fixes and enhancements in this release:
  * Added support for libavfilter to avformat module.
  * Added auto-rotate support to avformat producer.
  * Added animated GIF preset for avformat consumer.

API changes with some moderate testing of the 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 series
releases of both FFmpeg and Libav.


Version 0.7.2 - May 1, 2011

This is a minor release to fix a few things between the 0.7.0 release

address immediately. I noticed an extra unconditional colorspace conversion
to and from RGB was added for all YCbCr (YUV) video sources. In addition, I
have enabled the avcolor_space filter on OS X since it works now.


Version 0.5.8 - September 12, 2010

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is 0.6.
This is a maintenance release to address some bugs that appeared

Version 0.5.2 - March 10, 2010

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is SVN r21322.
This is a minor maintenance release, but it is interesting because it now
enables usage of libswscale as the default choice for image scaling,
image format conversion, and color space conversion. That gives better
quality and performance. In addition, there are some improvements in the
sdl_preview consumer to make it suitable for use in OpenShot 1.1. Other
things:

* Fixed mlt++/MltFilteredProducer
